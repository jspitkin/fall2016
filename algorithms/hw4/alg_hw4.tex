% HW Template for CS 6150, taken from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/class/02-714/hw-template.tex
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all 
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of 
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the 
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

\question{1}{Unique Minimum Spanning Trees}

\part{a}
Proof by contradiction: assume there are two minimum spanning trees T1 and T2.

take the smallest edge that exists in T1 or T2 and add it to T2 or T1. This forms a cycle.

Cycle property: the largest weighted edge in the cycle doesn't belong in the MST.

We won't remove e1, as it's the smallest weighted edge that exists. Therefore T2 wasn't a minimum spanning tree as we will remove an edge from T2 to form the new MST.

\part{b}

Wikipedia: If the minimum cost edge e of a graph is unique, then this edge is included in any MST.
