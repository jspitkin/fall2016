Homework 6

I have written my project in Python3. I have tested it on the CADE lab1-18 machine.
By default, I have the code to write the objective plot and perform cross-validation commented out.

If you run 'run.sh' it should take about 30 seconds and will show you the results I used in the table of my report.

Thank you :)
