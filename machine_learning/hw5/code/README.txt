Hello TA.

I have written my code using Python3 and tested it on CADE machine lab1-18.

I have a 'run.sh' script that will run all of my experiments. Be warned this will take several minutes to complete.
I have provided a .trace file of all of the outputs for my experiments. They are located in the 'code/traces' folder.

Thank you! ^o^
