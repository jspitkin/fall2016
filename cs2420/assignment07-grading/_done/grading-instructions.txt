ANALYSIS DOC (20 pts)
------------------------------------
1. [ 1 pt ]  (FYI)

2.  [ 3 pt ]  Accept any answer in which the explanation demonstrates knowledge of both kinds of linked lists.  I expect most students to recognize that "prev" links are unnecessary and are a waste of space and time (although it does not increase the bigh-oh).

3.  [ 3 pt ]  Accept any answer in which the explanation demonstrates knowledge of both our custom linked list and Java's.  I don't see any reason why the replacement cannot be made.

4.  [ 1 pt ]  Accept anything reasonable. The point is that the stack should be VERY simple to implement with a proper linked-list.

5.  [ 3 pt ]  Store information about the line and column number along with the unmatched opening symbol as you add it to the stack.

6.  [ 7 pt ]  In general, look for well-labeled plots.  Also, look for the students to have commented on the plots and explained any unexpected behavior.

  **Students only need to analyze the behavior of major stack operations---peek, pop, push.  The times are so small that normal oscillations will appear quite large and prevent a smooth plot.


7.  [ 1 pt ]  If anyone spent > 10 hours, that's a red flag.  We should investigate why they struggled so much.
