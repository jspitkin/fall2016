ANALYSIS DOC (40 pts)
------------------------------------
1.  [ 1 pt ]  (FYI)

2.  [ 1 pt ]  Accept anything reasonable.  If you think anyone had a serious problem that needs to be addressed, let me know.

3.  [ 10 pt ]  Students should have plotted at least 5 lines (one must be full mergesort, the others may be any threshold value).  As usual, the plot should have good labels and a title.  Times should be smallest at some value ~10 and then be quite large for large threshold values.  If you see results that you are sure are not correct, give feedback (sounds like they need more help with timing) and take off a few points.

4.  [ 10 pt ]  Students should have plotted at least 3 lines.  As usual, the plot should have good labels and a title. Depending on what pivot-choosing strategies they used, the times could be really large (N^2 or worse) or proportional to N log N.  If you see results that you are sure are not correct, give feedback (sounds like they need more help with timing) and take off a few points.

5.  [ 10 pt ]  Student may have plotted all 6 lines together, or 2 lines spread across 3 plots.  As usual, the plot should have good labels and a title.  For best, average, and worst cases, all meregesort lines should look N log N.  For the quicksort, it depends on the pivot strategy, but all cases should look somewhere between N log N and N^2.  If you see results that you are sure are not correct, give feedback (sounds like they need more help with timing) and take off a few points.

6.  [ 7 pt ]  Student should discuss their analysis. If their times are obviously off and they did not offer explanation as to why, take off a few points.

7.  [ 1 pt ]  If anyone spent > 20 hours, that's a red flag.  We should investigate why they struggled so much.
